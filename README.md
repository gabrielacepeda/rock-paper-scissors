## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this app. All you have to do is choose a weapon between rock, paper, scissors, spock or lizard and you either win, lose, or tie. Your score is also displayed. The computer chooses a random number and each weapon is assigned a random value.
## Optimizations

This app works efficiently.
## Lessons Learned:

Creating a functional game using JavaScript taught me how important pseduo code is to the perormance of your application.
